# Html-2-Pdf

This is an example of how to use the libraries
[openhtmltopdf](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf)
and 
[thymeleaf](https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf) to generate pdf from html without web context

To use a external file like a `*.css` you will need to make him available via a URI to be able to used it with thymeleaf.
