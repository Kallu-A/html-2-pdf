            The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (senten
            ce, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not
            without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very
            useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.

            The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used
            it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with
            their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to ge
